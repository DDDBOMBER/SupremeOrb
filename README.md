==========
A fast-paced multiplayer game in which you fight 1 on 1 in an arena. Both players take the role of a ball of light, who can shoot bullets of the same color as themselves. With added visual effects such as particles and flashes, and gameplay mechanics such as when a player gets hit, everything slows down.

#Ranked Matches
  A queue system for matches which finds you an opponent of a similar skill level. Rankings are based off an ELO system, on who you beat and who beats you. With visual icons for your "skill group" to encourage people to play more and win.
  
#Regular Tournaments, Ladders with Prize Badges
  Regular tournaments with a check-in system allowing you to sign up whenever you want. Regular Ladders with rankings separate from the ELO skill rankings, so anyone can come top of the ladder.Win badges that can be displayed, so whenever you go into a game, your opponents will know what you have achieved in the game.

#Profiles
  Make an account to track your ELO ranking, wins, losses and other statistics. Display your badges and add friends.
  
#Lobby
  Create a lobby and invite any online players or your friends. Host your own tournaments with players, or play freindly games that have no effect on your ranking.
