			<p>
				A fast-paced multiplayer game in which you fight 1 on 1 in an arena. Both players take the role of a ball of light, who can shoot bullets of the same color as themselves. With added visual effects such as particles and flashes, and gameplay mechanics such as when a player gets hit, everything slows down.

			<div class="title">Ranked Matches</div>
			<p>
				A queue system for matches which finds you an opponent of a similar skill level. Rankings are based off an ELO system, on who you beat and who beats you. With visual icons for your "skill group" to encourage people to play more and win. After 15 games win/lose you gain a rank.
			</p>	
			<div class="title">Regular Tournaments, Ladders with Prize Badges</div>
			<p>
				Regular tournaments with a check-in system allowing you to sign up whenever you want. Regular Ladders with rankings separate from the ELO skill rankings, so anyone can come top of the ladder. Win badges that can be displayed, so whenever you go into a game, your opponents will know what you have achieved in the game. The tournaments additionally add to rankings, meaning every game you play brings the game closer to accurately measuring your skill level.
			</p>	
			<div class="title">Profiles</div>
			<p>
				Accounts are mandatory to play online, without one you can only play against the computer. Make an account to track your ELO ranking, wins, losses and other statistics. Display your badges and add friends, to compete in public or private tournaments.
			</p>	
			<div class="title">Lobby</div>
			<p>
				Create a lobby and invite any online players or your friends. Host your own tournaments with players, or play freindly games that have no effect on your ranking.
			</p>	
			<div class="title">Free to Play with Premium Accounts</div>
			<p>
				The game will be free to play, but with advertisements in menus and in between games. However, premium accounts will be available to support the hosting of the game, which will remove advertisements but will not provide any advantage to the player in game. It is undecided but premium players may gain access to more tournaments, or have tournaments with prize pools.
